    <h1>A guide to typography character. </h1>
    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p> It all began when I realized I could my love fro cultural comparisions and graphic desing. This has taken many
        forms during my studies and has stayed with me since.
    </p>
    <p>By comparing English and Korean, Types of Type shows that there are many similarities across the two languages
        through the lense of typography. And, the differences between the two are equally telling. I learned a lot from
        putting this guide together, and hope you enjoy it.</p>
